# Cloud Lamp with Button
## Project Description
This idea started as an exhibition idea
Original Sketch was designed with multiple acrylic panels
However, led strips and acrylic panels worked most effectively 
having one led strip for each acrylic panel

With the constraints of using analog and digital in/out put,
the final design was made to a cloud lamp with button.

Intended for users who prefer having a lamp on during night,
the light sensor on the lamp detects the brightness level of the environment.
When the surroundings are bright, the light doesn't turn on 
when the surrounding brightness starts to dim, the lamp turns on


There's a rainbow pattern that repeats for the light pattern,
and the system starts when the atom board's default button is pressed
and turns off when the button is pressed again.

The physical mock up of the cloud lamp was designed using MDF wood and Acrylic board,
prepared by laser cut, and designed to leave space on the bottom for the led strip
and the button to be pressed


This project was a three week project, and there were many struggles 
understanding basics using and understanding sensors, digital outputs, 
and creating system states but I am happy with the outcome of this lamp project.

# Smart Home system 
## Project Summary
This project is a smart home system mockup using different sensors for input and led light as an output

It's a creative light experience for the house model, using different system states.
When the button is pressed to turn on the system, light sensor detects the brightness level near by through the roof window, and if it is bright the led light system of the house gets dimmer and if the surrounding is dark it gets brighter, automatically controlling the lighting environment. 

When the button is pressed for the second time, the system mode changes to home security mode where it checks if there are anything in the house using PIR sensor, and if the sensor detection is true, the light turns on to be bright red color with can be visible from even outside the house model and an email gets sent using IFTTT and webhooks to alert the user that there was a movement detected in the house.
